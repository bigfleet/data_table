h1. data_table:

h2. Status

We're in pre-alpha right now, I am trying to get this to meet my first requirements.

h2. Goal:

Define a filter in your controller, like so:

<pre><code>
Filter.spec(:name => :testing ) do |f|
  f.element(:type) do |e|
    e.default  "Foos and Bars", nil
    e.option   "Foos",          'foo'
    e.option   "Bars",          'bar'
  end
end
</code></pre>

resulting in the following:

* helpers on the front end to render selection box filters that know what option was selected, if any
* asking for a set of additional conditions to pass to a model-based finder
* helpers that avoid rendering complex filter data in query params
* sorting for free
* AJAX or non-AJAX modes
